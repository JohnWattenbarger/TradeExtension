App Basics:

This is a chrome extension that allows players to find optimal trades in their fantasy football league.

How to use:

Go to "https://www.fantasycalc.com/trade-calculator". When using this extension there should be extra tade finder fields to interact with (if they are missing try refreshing).

Input your league settings, and other preferences. Select a team from your league, and click "Find Trades" to see what trades are available.

Trade Result Fields:

Detailed View:
- Trade Partner
- Player given | Player given value
- Team Value Before Trade: Combined Team Player Value before the trade (only including starting players)
- Team Value After Trade: Combined Team Player Value after the trade (only including starting players)
- Team Improvement: How much value you gained in starting players. So if for example you give a backup QB you lose no starting player value.
- Player Value Gained: Difference in value between the player you are receiving, and the player you are giving. A positive value means you received more value than you gave.

Simple View:
- (Player Given) - (Player Received) ==> (Selected team improvement) / (Other team improvement), difference: (difference in value between the player you received vs the player you gave)
