 > Create a simplified view of Results
   > Add a toggle in tradeCalculator
   > Should look like example.txt
 > Add a toggle in tradeCalculator (or maybe a min input) for only positive values
 > Add an input for how many trades to show (currently set to 5)
 > Create a "Top" column that shows the trades that give your team the biggest boost
 > Cleanup code
   > Separate rendering out better
   > Clear TODOs
 > See if clicking the logo should turn extension on/off
 > Separate out my rendering to a better location
